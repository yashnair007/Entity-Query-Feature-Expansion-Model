## Features
- **Inverted Index**: Efficient data structure for quick lookups of documents containing specific terms.
- **Query Expansion**: Enhances user queries to improve retrieval performance.
- **Compression Techniques**: Reduces storage requirements while maintaining search efficiency.
- **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity**: Calculates relevance scores between queries and documents.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset derived from MS MARCO, which includes a collection of real Bing questions and corresponding passage texts. The dataset enables the evaluation of information retrieval techniques in a realistic context.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization and cleaning of text data to prepare it for indexing.
2. **Indexing**: Implementation of inverted indexing, biword indexes, and positional indexes.
3. **Query Processing**: Application of query expansion techniques to improve search results.
4. **Ranking**: Utilization of TF-IDF and cosine similarity metrics to rank the relevance of documents against queries.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing system performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the system.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Regular Expressions**: For text processing and tokenization.
